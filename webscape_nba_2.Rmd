## All Players Dataframe
I used the other script to get the `all_players_df` dataframe which contains all the links from basketball-reference.com. I'll be using this dataframe to choose players of interest. First, I'm going to query "Stephen Curry".

```{r}
steph <- all_players_df %>% filter(grepl("Stephen Curry", hover))
steph
```

```{r}
this_player_url <- as.character(steph[2])
webpage_2 <- read_html(this_player_url)
results_2 <- webpage_2 %>% html_nodes("table")

pg_table <- html_table(results_2)[[1]]
pg_table <- pg_table %>% filter(grepl("\\-", Season))
pg_table
```
